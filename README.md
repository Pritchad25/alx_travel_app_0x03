# Project Title: ALX Travel App

## About The Project
- the alxtravelapp project is a real-world Django application that serves as the foundation for a travel listing platform. This milestone focuses on setting up the initial project structure, configuring a robust database, and integrating tools to ensure API documentation and maintainable configurations. The aim is to equip learners with industry-standard best practices for starting and managing Django-based projects efficiently.
- This milestone will teach you to set up a scalable backend, integrate MySQL for database management, and use Swagger for automated API documentation. These foundational steps are critical in preparing the application for future features and seamless team collaboration.

## Learning Objective
- As a professional developer, this task will enable you to:
- 1. Master Advanced Project Initialization: 
	- Learn to bootstrap Django projects with modular, production-ready configurations.
	- Employ environment variable management for secure and scalable settings.
- 2. Integrate Key Developer Tools:
	- Set up and use Swagger (via drf-yasg) for API documentation.
	- Implement CORS headers and MySQL configurations for robust API interactions.
- 3. Collaborate Effectively Using Git:
	- Structure your projects for team collaboration with a version-controlled setup.
- 4. Adopt Industry Best Practices:
	- Follow best practices in managing dependencies, database configurations, and application structure.

## Requirements
- To successfully complete this milestone, ensure you meet the following prerequisites:
	- Familiarity with Django and Django REST Framework.
	- Knowledge of MySQL and database management.
	- Understanding of version control using Git.
	- A basic grasp of environment variable management using `django-environ`

## Key Highlights
- 1. Project Initialization:
	- Create a Django project named alxtravelapp
	- Add an app named listings to encapsulate core functionalities.
- 2. Dependency Management:
	- Install essential packages
		- `django`: Core framework for application development.
	- `djangorestframework`: REST API development.
	- `django-cors-headers`: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing setup.
	- `drf-yasg`: Swagger API documentation.
	- `celery` and `rabbitmq`: For future task queuing and background processes.
- 3. Settings Configuration:
 	- Use `django-environ` to securely handle environment variables in `.env` files.
	- Configure MySQL as the primary database, ensuring proper connection handling in `settings.py`
	- Set up REST framework and CORS headers for API support.
- 4. Swagger Integration:
	- Integrate Swagger for comprehensive API documentation.
	- Ensure all APIs are automatically documented and accessible at `/swagger/`
- 5. Version Control and Submission:
	- Initialize a Git repository and commit all project setup files.
	- Push your code to a GitHub repository named alxtravelapp with the specified structure.
